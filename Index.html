                <h1>Hello, my name is Chris welcome to my site!</h1>
                <h1 id='text2'>These are a few of my favorite things...</h1>
<div id='text'>  
    
    <ul>            
                    <li>I like music all types of genres.</li>
                    <li>I also like smoking vintage cigars,watching sports and flying sports planes.</li>
                    <li>My favorite reality show is Shank Tank (gotta love that show).</li>
                    <li>I enjoy traveling to Jazz Festivals on different Islands. I've been to almost every Jazz Festival in the carribbean. </li>
                    <li>However, I spend most of my time managing a site called 2-mintue drill.</li>
                    <li>Come on in and I'll tell you more about it.</li>
                    <li>First of all Sports Gambling is legal, and it been legal since 2016.</li>
                    <li>So me and some friends started this site/app called 2-minute drill. 2-minute drill allows you to bet on games in the last two minutes which creates a competive edge.</li>
                    <li>The way it works is you have up until the last two-minutes before you got one the site perdict the final score.</li>
                    <li>2-minute drill winners get to cash out and win their earnings immediately after each game without waiting .
                    <li>Also the more you enter the more chances you have to win.
                    <li>I came up with this idea after being on Draft Kings or Fanduel and having wait for an entire game to end before collecting my earnings.</li>
                    <li>On those sites you get paid based on how well the players you Draft are doing. However, on 2-mintue drill you get paid immediately after games.</li> 
                    <li>You get paid more when you play more!</li>
                    <li>The first weekend in September we got more than 25K players!</li> 
                    <li>Unfortunatley we've had to take the site down because of last weekend our web server crashed.</li>
